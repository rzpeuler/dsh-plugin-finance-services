Workers return review requests to their main/Host, never ask users directly. Inputs and installed assets are read-only; designated writers alone may write new files within the runtime-assigned financial artifact directory, never replace user originals.

The runtime assigns the financial artifact directory for each session/run (normally <workspace>/financial-services/artifacts/<session-id>/); request it if absent. Do not invent an API to allocate it.



# NAV tie-out

Given a generated LP statement and the period's NAV pack (via the nav MCP), independently recompute the LP's capital account and compare line by line.

> **The generated statement is the thing under test.** The NAV pack is the source of truth.

## Recompute the LP capital account

```
Beginning capital (prior statement ending)
  + Contributions (capital calls paid this period)
  − Distributions (cash + in-kind)
  + Allocated net income / (loss)
      = LP% × (realized + unrealized P&L − management fee − fund expenses)
  − Carried interest allocation (if crystallized this period)
Ending capital
```

Pull each input from the NAV pack: LP commitment %, fund-level P&L components, fee and expense totals, waterfall outputs.

## Compare

For each line on the statement, compare to your recomputed value. Tolerance: `0.01`. For each mismatch, note which input drives it (e.g., "allocated P&L differs — statement used 12.40% ownership, NAV pack shows 12.38% after the Q1 transfer").

## Additional checks

- Ending capital on this statement = beginning capital on next period's draft (if available).
- Sum of all LP ending capitals = fund NAV (within rounding).
- Commitment, unfunded, and recallable figures agree to the commitment register.

## Output

A pass/fail per line, the recomputed values alongside the statement values, and a list of flags. Do not edit the statement — the publisher acts on the flags after review.
