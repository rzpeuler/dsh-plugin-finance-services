description: Clean up messy spreadsheet data — trim whitespace, fix inconsistent casing, convert numbers-stored-as-text, standardize dates, remove duplicates, and flag mixed-type columns. Use when data is messy, inconsistent, or needs prep before analysis. Triggers on "clean this data", "clean up this sheet", "normalize this data", "fix formatting", "dedupe", "standardize this column", "this data is messy".

Skill access never grants tools or data permissions. Runtime capability availability overrides upstream examples. Commercial data is NOT_CONFIGURED until P3 registers and authorizes an appropriate adapter; never fabricate a provider response or treat public web search as equivalent to KYC/NAV/consensus. Office/script execution and external /mnt paths, recalc.py and other platform runtimes require P4 adaptation; do not execute bundled source scripts from a role. Preserve all business checks and review requests; P2 carries prompt-level reviews only, NOT a P5 deterministic enforced Gate. Workers return review requests to their main/Host, never ask users directly. Inputs and installed assets are read-only; designated writers alone may write new files within the runtime-assigned financial artifact directory, never replace user originals. Do not assume ./out or an open Office document. The runtime assigns the financial artifact directory for each session/run (normally <workspace>/financial-services/artifacts/<session-id>/); request it if absent. Do not invent an API to allocate it.



# Clean Data

Clean messy data in the active sheet or a specified range.

## Environment

- **If running inside Excel (Office Add-in / Office JS):** Use Office JS directly (`Excel.run(async (context) => {...})`). Read via `range.values`, write helper-column formulas via `range.formulas = [["=TRIM(A2)"]]`. The in-place vs helper-column decision still applies.
- **If operating on a standalone .xlsx file:** Use Python/openpyxl.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Scope

- If a range is given (e.g. `A1:F200`), use it
- Otherwise use the full used range of the active sheet
- Profile each column: detect its dominant type (text / number / date) and identify outliers

### Step 2: Detect issues

| Issue | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Whitespace | leading/trailing spaces, double spaces |
| Casing | inconsistent casing in categorical columns (`usa` / `USA` / `Usa`) |
| Number-as-text | numeric values stored as text; stray `$`, `,`, `%` in number cells |
| Dates | mixed formats in the same column (`3/8/26`, `2026-03-08`, `March 8 2026`) |
| Duplicates | exact-duplicate rows and near-duplicates (case/whitespace differences) |
| Blanks | empty cells in otherwise-populated columns |
| Mixed types | a column that's 98% numbers but has 3 text entries |
| Encoding | mojibake (`Ã©`, `â€™`), non-printing characters |
| Errors | `#REF!`, `#N/A`, `#VALUE!`, `#DIV/0!` |

### Step 3: Propose fixes

Show a summary table before changing anything:

| Column | Issue | Count | Proposed Fix |
|---|---|---|---|

### Step 4: Apply

- **Prefer formulas over hardcoded cleaned values** — where the cleaned output can be expressed as a formula (e.g. `=TRIM(A2)`, `=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(B2,"$",""))`, `=UPPER(C2)`, `=DATEVALUE(D2)`), write the formula in an adjacent helper column rather than computing the result in Python and overwriting the original. This keeps the transformation transparent and auditable.
- Only overwrite in place with computed values when the user explicitly asks for it, or when no sensible formula equivalent exists (e.g. encoding/mojibake repair)
- For destructive operations (removing duplicates, filling blanks, overwriting originals), confirm with the user first
- After each category of fix (whitespace → casing → number conversion → dates → dedup), show the user a sample of what changed and get confirmation before moving to the next category
- Report a before/after summary of what changed
